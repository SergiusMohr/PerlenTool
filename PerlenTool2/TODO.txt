SwingUtilities
public static final boolean isRectangleContainingRectangle(Rectangle a, Rectangle b)

Many Swing components support bound properties as defined by the JavaBeans specification. In the
java.beans package, a utility class called PropertyChangeSupport is defined to help you register
property change listeners and fire property change events. The PropertyChangeSupport class does
this work in a thread-safe manner that consumes a good bit of memory. The
SwingPropertyChangeSupport class provides exactly the same set of features, but does so without
thread-safety to reduce memory usage and increase performance. If you're building your own
components, you can use this class instead of PropertyChangeSupport. (For more information on
JavaBeans and bound properties, check out O'Reilly's Developing Java Beans, by Robert
Englander.)
